I am interested in the research work related to machine learning, data mining and application of these techniques. 
In particular short text mining and sportS analytics.

*Current work:*

My academic (PhD) research is focused on the identification of strengths and weakness of cricket players.
Knowledge of strengths and weaknesses of players is the key for team selection and strategy planning.
Central idea is to mine strength and weakness rules using short text commentary data.

*Past work:*

Spectral clustering using convex and constrained settings, where I proposed a framework to incorporate pairwise constraints in to semidefinite spectral clustering. Further extended it from passive to active and self taught learning settings. 

In addition, I do a lot of side projects that push my boundaries or teach me something new. 
For example, Community detection using greedy clique and plex algorithm where I implemented the existing Greedy Clique Algorithm (GCE) for community detection which uses cliques as seeds. Further I proposed a novel Greedy Plex Algorithm, a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques.
