I am interested in the research work related to machine learning, data mining and
application of these techniques. In particular short text mining and sport analytics.

*Past work*

My academic research focused on the evolution and ecology of primates and parasites. Specific research topics included modeling the [evolution of complex 3D shapes](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/11/10/plotting-shape-changes-geomorph.html), quantifying the structure of [primate social networks](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/04/26/primate-social-networks-in-igraph.html), characterizing the spatial scale of [mosquito habitat preferences](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/05/23/mosquito-community-ecology-in-vegan.html), and proving that [tapeworms can kill monkeys](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/gelada). I've done some computer simulation-based [statistical methods research](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/pcm) and authored an [R package](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/btw) for fitting Bayesian models of trait evolution. 

In addition, I do a lot of side projects that push my boundaries or teach me something new. For example, I recently scraped and analyzed 120 years of historical data on [Olympic athletes and medal results](https://rgriff23.github.io/2018/05/27/olympic-history-1-web-scraping.html) from www.sports-reference.com, which introduced me to R packages for web scraping, drawing maps, and creating interactive plots. As another example, I used social network and sentiment analysis to break down data on users and tweets in a [Twitterstorm](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/29/Katie-Hinde-Twitterstorm.html), which introduced me to working with Twitter, text, and social network data.

*Personal*

I live in CT with my girlfriend, dog, and cat. Meet Cody the dog and Spock the cat.

Sorry about the eyeshine. I'll get a good pic of them together one day!

*Ice hockey*

I play professional women's ice hockey for the [Connecticut Whale](https://www.theicegarden.com/2018/7/10/17553146/connecticut-whale-sign-randi-griffin-sarah-hughson-re-sign-hanna-beattie-team-korea-free-agency) and internationally for [Team Korea](https://today.duke.edu/2018/03/duke-olympian-will-soon-defend-her-phd). Previously, I played varsity women's ice hockey at [Harvard University](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/2/1/randi-griffin-15q/). When I'm not playing, I coach!
