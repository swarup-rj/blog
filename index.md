I am interested in the research work related to machine learning, data mining and application of these techniques. 
In particular short text mining and sport analytics.

*Past work*

My academic research focused on the mining of strengths and weakness of cricket players.
Specific research topics included: (i) Mining of strengths and weakness of cricket players using cricket text commentary where I use machine learning and text mining techniques to mine for strategies in sports domain and  (ii) Spectral clustering using convex and constrained settings where I proposed a framework to incorporate pairwise constraints in to semidefinite spectral spectral clustering. It was then extended from passive learning to active learning and self taught learning settings. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation was validated by comparing to existing spectral  clustering methods. 

In addition, I do a lot of side projects that push my boundaries or teach me something new. 
For example, Community detection using greedy clique and plex algorithm where I implemented the existing Greedy Clique Algorithm (GCE) for community detection which uses Cliques as seeds. Further I proposed a novel Greedy Plex Algorithm, a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques.
