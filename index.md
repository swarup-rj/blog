<p><h2>About me</h2></p>

___

I am a PhD student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Dr. Vijaya V. Saradhi](https://www.iitg.ac.in/saradhi/personal.html/). My academic (PhD) research is focused on the identification of strengths and weaknesses of [Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) players using [short text commentary](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21842785/siddhartha-vaidyanathan-online-cricket-text-commentary-pioneer-robert-elz) data. 

Before this, I earned my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Vijaya V. Saradhi](https://www.iitg.ac.in/saradhi/personal.html/) on the problem - Spectral clustering using convex and constrained settings, where I proposed a framework to incorporate pairwise constraints in to semidefinite spectral clustering. Further extended it from passive to active and self taught learning settings.
