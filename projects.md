### Research

##### *Active*

1. Identification of strengths and weakness of players in the game of Cricket:  
Computationally, learning individual players strengths and weaknesses is a non-trivial and an unexplored machine learning problem that has significant commercial value. It is the key for team selection and strategy planning.
Central idea is to mine strength and weakness rules using short text commentary data.

##### *Recently Active* 
1. Spectral clustering using convex and constrained settings:  
Proposed a framework to incorporate pairwise constraints in to semidefinite spectral clustering. 
Further extended it from passive to active and self taught learning settings.
2. A novel Ontology based Entity Relationship model:  
A comprehensive study of Entity Relationship model was done. 
Its limitations were explored and a novel Ontology Based Entity Relationship model was proposed.

### Course Projects
1. Community detection using greedy clique and plex algorithm:  
 Implemented the existing Greedy Clique Algorithm (GCE) for community detection which uses cliques as seeds. Further proposed a novel Greedy Plex Algorithm, a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques.
2. Search Engine for Information Retrieval
