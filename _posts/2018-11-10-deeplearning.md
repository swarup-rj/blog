###### Goal
* To automatically extract data from the web and present it in a desired format.
+ We will discuss a basic example of web scraping where we extract latest stories (headlines) from a news website (Times of India, Guwahati Page). Everything (atleast the text) you see on the web can be extracted ;-) . Refer to [Beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) documentation for more details.
