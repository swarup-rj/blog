###### Goal
* To demonstrate a simple implementation of Word2Vec.
+ To implement Word2Vec model using gensim and python3.

###### Data
[Text Commentaries of batsman Steve Smith](assets/data/SmithCommentary.csv)
{% highlight python %}
'''
gets another no ball from Gul first up  apart from that it was a good delivery  yorker that Smith just jabbed a bat down in time on

this is better  in the sense that it was a legal delivery  but worse in terms of line  giving Smith an early chance to leave alone outside off

this was a touch wide again  but not as wide as Gul smile after he saw this bend away late  big reverse swing  which might keep things interesting

gets the line right  perhaps its a touch too short though and Smith gets behind a solid defence

well judged by Smith  who looks confident enough leaving alone

Smith is away  working this to midwicket and scampering through for a single

###### Code
{% highlight python %}
#Import dependencies
import pandas as pd
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

#Data loading and preprocessing
data = pd.read_csv('SmithCommentary.csv', names = ['commentaries'])
commentaries = list(data['commentaries'])
commentaries = [commentary.lower() for commentary in commentaries]
list_of_list = [word_tokenize(commentary) for commentary in commentaries]

#Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(list_of_list, min_count=1,size= 50,workers=3, window =4)

#Check word embedding
embedding = model['defence']
print(embedding)

#Check word similarity
similarity = model.similarity('defence', 'leave')
print(similarity)

most_similar = model.most_similar('defence')
print(most_similar)
