###### Goal
* To demonstrate a simple implementation of Word2Vec.
+ To implement Word2Vec model using gensim and python3.

###### Import dependencies
{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
{% endhighlight %}

###### Load the data
Data: [6 text Commentaries for batsman Steve Smith](https://swarup-rj.github.io/assets/data/SmithCommentary.csv)
{% highlight python %}
data = pd.read_csv('SmithCommentary.csv', names = ['commentaries'])
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
>>> pprint(data)
                                        commentaries

###### Code

#Import dependencies
import pandas as pd
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

#Data loading and preprocessing
data = pd.read_csv('SmithCommentary.csv', names = ['commentaries'])
commentaries = list(data['commentaries'])
commentaries = [commentary.lower() for commentary in commentaries]
list_of_list = [word_tokenize(commentary) for commentary in commentaries]

#Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(list_of_list, min_count=1,size= 50,workers=3, window =4)

#Check word embedding
embedding = model['defence']
print(embedding)

#Check word similarity
similarity = model.similarity('defence', 'leave')
print(similarity)

most_similar = model.most_similar('defence')
print(most_similar)
