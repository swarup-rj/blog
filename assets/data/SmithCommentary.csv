gets another no ball from Gul first up  apart from that it was a good delivery  yorker that Smith just jabbed a bat down in time on
this is better  in the sense that it was a legal delivery  but worse in terms of line  giving Smith an early chance to leave alone outside off
this was a touch wide again  but not as wide as Gul smile after he saw this bend away late  big reverse swing  which might keep things interesting
gets the line right  perhaps its a touch too short though and Smith gets behind a solid defence
well judged by Smith  who looks confident enough leaving alone
Smith is away  working this to midwicket and scampering through for a single
