This is the term project (M.Tech) for the course of Computational System Biology. I have implemented the existing Greedy Clique Algorithm (GCE) for community detection which uses cliques as seeds. Further proposed a novel Greedy Plex Algorithm, a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques. Used C++ and UCINET tool.

### Abstract:

Detecting communities in graphs is of great importance not only because it is the most relevant features of graphs but also for the fact that in all disciplines the systems are represented as graphs. In literature many Community Assignment Algorithms (CAAs) exists, but all these suffer when the graphs have scale-free degree and community size distribution as well as overlapping communities. In these contexts Greedy Clique Expansion (GCE) performs considerably well. However GCE places a strict requirement while choosing the seed that any community that can be found by GCE must contain a clique k or more nodes. GCE is the only algorithm that gives good results on Synthetic Graphs, in which each node belongs to multiple communities. The working of the GCE, Implementation and computational results are briefed in this report. Also mentioned an algorithm GPE a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques.
