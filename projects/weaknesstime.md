### Abstract:

In this work, we present an application of tensor decomposition for discrete random variable tensor. In particular, we construct a tensor using cricket short text commentary data by employing domain-specific features. The aim is to understand the temporal changes in the strength rules and weakness rules of a player. Three-way correspondence analysis (TWCA) is employed to obtain the factors that show dependency between batting features, bowling features, and time respectively. Change in strength rules and weakness rules for Australian batsman Steve Smith (Test Rank \#1 ICC player) are presented.
