This is the term project (M.Tech) for the course of Computational System Biology. I have implemented the existing Greedy Clique Algorithm (GCE) for community detection which uses cliques as seeds. Further proposed a novel Greedy Plex Algorithm, a variant of GCE which uses plexes in place of cliques. Used C++ and UCINET tool.

### Abstract:

In this project we have made a comprehensive study of Entity Relationship (ER) model which is one of the widely used frameworks for design of database systems.  We have explored the limitations of ER model and proposed a novel Ontology Based Entity Relationship (OBER) model by introducing a new layer in to the existing three layer architecture of ER model.  Our proposed four layer OBER model integrates the concept of ontology in to the ER model.  Using a Medical Database we have illustrated the advantages of our proposed model over ER model.  We have also explored some challenging research issues and scope for future work associated with our proposed model.
