### Abstract:

Constrained spectral clustering has been well studied in the recent years. Many formulations have been proposed e.g. passive, active, self taught, depending on the way in which the constraints are provided. While substantial work has been done on integrating constraints in spectral clustering, no such attempt have been made in case of semidefinite spectral clustering. In this paper we propose a framework which incorporates pairwise constraints in to semidefinite spectral spectral clustering. We extend it from passive learning to active learning and self taught learning settings. We validate the effectiveness of our formulation compared to existing spectral clustering methods by empirical study on well known databases.
